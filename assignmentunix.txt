  A symbolic is an actual link to the original file, whereas a hard link is a mirror copy of the original file. 
  If you delete the original file, the soft link has no value, because it points to a non-existent file.
  But in the case of hard link, it is entirely opposite. Even if you delete the original file, 
  the hard link will still has the data of the original file. And it is giving name to the file.
